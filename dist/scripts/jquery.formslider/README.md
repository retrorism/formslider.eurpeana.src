[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/jquery.formslider.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/jquery.formslider/)

This jquery.formslider integrates a modified [Flexslider](https://github.com/formslider/FlexSlider) with logical slide pages that can have features and behaviors provided by plugins.

The main goal is to have different actions triggered depending on what type the actual slide page is. You can stop going forward when a formula is invalid for example.

The Library is very small, performance optimized, full responsive and touch capable. You can easily write you own plugins and implement custom slide behavior.

Have a look at the example implementation [formslider.github.io](https://formslider.github.io/).

## Installation
```bash
bower install jquery.formslider --save

# or

npm install jquery.formslider --save
```

## Integration
Check out this guide: [INTEGRATION](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

A minimal demo can bechecked out here: https://github.com/formslider/jquery.formslider.demo.

### Example use case
A possible use case is as follows:
  * you have a few **question slides** the user can answer and go forth and back
  * there is a **zipcode slide** the user enters a valid zip code
  * the **loader slide** makes a loading animation while navigation is blocked
  * the **contact slide** collects contact information and submits them together with the answers if the input is valid
  * the **confirmation slide** show information while no further navigation allowed

This functionality is provided by plugins. You can develop your own flow as you like by extend or configure plugins.

  * InputFocus                    # focusses first input on current slide
  * InputNormalizer               # does some normalization on inputs
  * InputSync                     # syncs inputs with the same name
  * JqueryValidate                # validates inputs before leaving a slide, uses jquery-validate

# loader
  * SimpleLoader                  # controls a loading page with no user interaction allowed

# navigation controller           # controller can be stacked as they cancel the `controller.*` events when they succeed
